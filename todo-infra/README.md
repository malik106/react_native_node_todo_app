# Todo App - Infra

## Installation
- Install and start docker-compose by running below mentioned command :-

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

-  React Native doesn't support localhost with http for api calls. That's why we need to add ip address as a host in frontend.env file. Your ip address will look like 192.XXX.XX.XXX . To get your ip address run the following command in linux based terminal :-

    ```sh
    ipconfig
    ```

-  To run application on web browser visit the link :-
    ```
    http://localhost:19006
    ```
